  "readme": "MySQL Connector/Node.js with X DevAPI\n=====================================\n\nThe Node.js Connector is an asynchronous promise-based client library for the\nX DevAPI and he X Protocol that was introduced in MySQL 5.7.12.\n\nMySQL 5.7 is an open-source relational database that is secure, high\nperforming, and easy to use. The X DevAPI supports relational tables and JSON \ndocuments making it possible to use both tables and collections at the same\ntime.\n\nFor general information about the X DevAPI, please refer to documentation on\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en/\n\nRequirements\n------------\nThis library requires at least Node.js 4.2 and MySQL 5.7.12.\n\nInstallation\n------------\nThis library is organized in a way that it can be installed using Node.js's npm\ntool into your project:\n  `npm install mysql-connector-nodejs-1.0.5.tar.gz`\nor diectly from npmjs.com:\n  `npm install @mysql/xdevapi`\nPlease refer to http://npmjs.com for more information on npm.\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\nA simple JavaScript file using this library follows:\n\n\n    const xdevapi = require('@mysql/xdevapi');\n\n    xdevapi.getSession({\n        host: 'localhost',\n        port: 33060,\n        dbUser: 'root',\n        dbPassword: ''\n    }).then(function (session) {\n        return session.createSchema(\"test_schema\").then(function (schema) {\n            return schema.createCollection(\"myCollection\");\n        }).then(function (collection) {\n            return Promise.all([\n                collection.add(\n                    {baz: { foo: \"bar\"}},\n                    {foo: { bar: \"baz\"}}\n                ).execute(),\n                collection.find(\"$.baz.foo == 'bar'\").execute(function (row) {\n                    console.log(\"Row: %j\", row);\n                }).then(function (res) {\n                    console.log(\"Collection find done!\");\n                }),\n                collection.remove(\"($.foo.bar) == 'baz'\").execute().then(function () {\n                    console.log(\"Document deleted\");\n                }),\n                collection.drop()\n            ]);\n        }).then(function () {\n            return session.dropSchema(\"test_schema\");\n        }).then(function () {\n            return session.close();\n        });\n    }).catch(function (err) {\n        console.log(err.stack);\n        process.exit();\n    });\n\n\nLicense\n-------\nThis is a release of MySQL Connector for Node.js, Oracle's dual-\nlicense Node.js Driver for MySQL.
